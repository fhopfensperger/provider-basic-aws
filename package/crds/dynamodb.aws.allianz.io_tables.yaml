                      in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. \n Each KeySchemaElement
                      in the array is composed of: \n    * AttributeName - The name
                      of this key attribute. \n    * KeyType - The role that the key
                      attribute will assume: HASH - partition    key RANGE - sort
                      key \n The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                      attribute. The term \"hash attribute\" derives from the DynamoDB
                      usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data
                      items across partitions, based on their partition key values.
                      \n The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute.
                      The term \"range attribute\" derives from the way DynamoDB stores
                      items with the same partition key physically close together,
                      in sorted order by the sort key value. \n For a simple primary
                      key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with
                      a KeyType of HASH. \n For a composite primary key (partition
                      key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements, in
                      this order: The first element must have a KeyType of HASH, and
                      the second element must have a KeyType of RANGE. \n For more
